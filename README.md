## Create an Ubuntu AWS EC2 instance.

If you don't have ubuntu or virtual machine then use AWS and host a temprory ubuntu OS on cloud.

1. Signup and create an account on AWS.
2. Download and install [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php).
3. Download and install [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
4. In AWS search for EC2 -> Launch Instances -> search UBUNTU select t2.micro and launch.
5. Follow [this steps](https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-recipes/connect-to-your-ec2-instance-using-putty-v1-1/) and open ubuntu terminal.

Now open FileZilla and connect the instance
